# PhotoCrop
This is a photo cropping application for devices supporting an Android OS (API>=19). The application uses the crop Intent from the default lists of intents, stores the captured photo from the camera and also stores the cropped image. This image is later displayed in an ImageView in MainActvity's layout.
